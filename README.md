# Module One Challenge

## Description
This webpage is for a company called Horiseon. The purpose of the webpage is to give the user more information on search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. The webpage has three links to take the user directly to more information on each aformentioned topic.

I completed this project by downloading the starter code from github and refactoring it using VS Code. I used HTML and CSS to refactor the code into semantic elements and clean up the style page.
